\section*{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented a unifying framework to approximate solutions of various OT-related linear programs through entropic regularization. This regularization enables the use of simple, yet powerful, iterative KL projection methods. While the entropy penalization is not a competitor with interior point methods when it comes to accurately solving the initial linear program, it produces fast approximations at the expense of an extra smoothing. It is thus a method of choice for many applications such as machine learning, image processing or economics.
